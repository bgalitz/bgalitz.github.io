I have been using [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) at work for the past year. I am in the process of converting these to [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts using [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) and hope to begin posting these to my GitHub repository as soon as I have time. 

A few of the automated jobs that I have built:
1 - Automatically approving my Financials Taskslist (approving invoices matched)
2 - Automated receipt of BOM (Bill Only Materials) Purchase Orders
3 - Adding items to a par location
4 - Sentact to PeopleSoft Automation
