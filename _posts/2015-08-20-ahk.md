I have been using [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) at work for the past year. I am in the process of converting these to [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts using [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) and hope to begin posting these to my GitHub repository as soon as I have time. 

A few of the automated jobs that I have built:
Automatically approving my Financials Taskslist (approving invoices matched)
- A recent PeopleSoft upgrade is now populating my Tasklist with 50-100 unnecessary match requests per day.
- At approximately 40 seconds per approval, this job saves me anywhere from 30-60 minutes per day.

Automated receipt of BOM (Bill Only Materials) Purchase Orders
- an I.T. request for the past 3 years.
- Purchase Orders are cut solely to pay for product that has already been utilized.
- By using the origin code BOM at the header level of the PO, a query is run to provide .csv input list.
- the job pulls each line (PO) and Fully Receives it in PeopleSoft.
- Previously a tech was performing this function 
- at 60 seconds per receipt x 100 per week, this job reduces inefficiency and saves nearly 2 hours per week

Adding items to a par location
- another I.T. request that has gone unfulfilled...
- the request: load an Excel spreadsheet into the Par Location definitions.
- There was a solution built briefly a year ago (just before the upgrade to 9.3). 
- The upgrade broke the links and the consultant is not available to fix it. 
- The script takes a .csv list of items and adds them (one at a time) to a par location. 
- It's 30 faster than an employee and replaces the need for that labor
- Assuming 1 new par location a month with an average of 240 items, that's another 4 hours of labor per month
