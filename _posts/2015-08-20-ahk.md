I have been using AutoHotkey at work for the past year. I am in the process of converting these to Python scripts because the AHK versions are volatile. They work and have error-checking but rely to heavily on x, y coordinates for fulfilling actions. This is not ideal if used on any other screen size or if the window sie changes.
