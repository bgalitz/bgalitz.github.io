I have been using [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) at work for the past year. I am in the process of converting these to [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts because the AHK versions are volatile. They work well, have saved me a ton of time, and have error-checking built in but they rely heavily on x, y coordinates for fulfilling keystrokes. This is not ideal if run from a different pc (with a larger or smaller screen size) or if the window isn't completely maximized on the home screen it was built for...

A few of the jobs that I use every day:
-Automatically approving my Financials Taskslist (approving invoices matched)
-Receiving the Bill Only Purchase Orders based on text file
-Adding items to a par location
