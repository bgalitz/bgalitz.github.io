I finally got around to putting this old website together on Github. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be...but will I be more inclined to post regularly???

I must give a "shout out" to [jmcglone.com](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)for the invaluable tutorial! Thanks!!!
