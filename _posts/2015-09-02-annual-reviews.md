title: "Annual Review Automation Fun"

Since our fiscal year ends in August and we recently acquired 2 more hospitals, I have the pleasure of completing physical inventory, training staff at the new locations, annual employee reviews for 41 staff members, trying to match AP's list of outstanding invoices (so my budget next year won't be negatively impacted) and a myriad of other day-to-day challenges.

In order to get some of these manual items off my list, I recently built an autohotkey script to put reviews into all of my staff entries within the "Best People Portal". I asked all my employees to complete a self-assessmentby the end of August. If not, they can only get a 3 out of 5. All of my union staff opted to skip this exercise which is how I completed 25 employee reviews in an hour. Awesome.
