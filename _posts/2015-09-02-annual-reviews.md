title: "Annual Review Automation Fun"

Since our fiscal year ends in August and we recently acquired 2 more hospitals, I get stuck completing physical inventory
training a the new locations, PeopleSoft support, staff reviews, unmatched invioces and myriad of other day-to-day challenges.

In order to get some of these off my list, I recently built an autohotkey script to put generic reviews into all of my staff entries within the "Best People Portal".
Since my union employees receive raises whether their performance is horrible or amazing - I gave them an ultimatum: complete
a self-assessment or receive a generic review. 100% of them chose not to complete a self-assessment and I managed to finish
30 reviews in under an hour. Now I'll have a whole week to complete my non-union staff reviews.
