title: Brian Galitz About Me...

<div class="blurb">
        <p>             I started college wanting to be an educator. I was working toward by Bachelor's Degree in Education when 
                I began my career in healthcare working as an Inventory Analyst. Our team partnered with pharmacies, long-term care 
                facilities and surgical centers to capture financial data, expired product, inventory valuations and make recommendations about 
                par values. It was a lot of travel (and very long days) but the collaboration and camaraderie was energizing. 
                With my prior experience having only been in retail, it was eye-opening to see how different 
                healthcare providers were managing. </p>
                
                
                 <p>       After 4 years of consistent travel - I found myself at a crossroad. I enjoyed the work but the constant 
                travel meant I could only enroll in class part-time. I needed a more consistent work schedule so I could focus on school.
                In 2004, I took a position at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and immediately took over the Supply Chain management 
                for ENT, Plastics, Eye and Anesthesia departments at the Feinberg pavilion while 
                facilitating the Olson Outpatient Pavilion expansion. It was a great fit because it was an extremely 
                dynamic environment and I was able to collaborate with many of the departments that were moving. </p>
                         
                         
                <p> I switched my major from Education to Computer Science so I could complete my degree without having to
                change jobs. This allowed me to grow in my position, work on interesting projects that added value for the organization 
                and over the course of 14 years led to leadership opportunities.
                While working full-time and completing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science I was part of the Olson Expansion, 
                Prentice Women’s hospital expansion, Lake Forest and Grayslake acquisition, Grayslake Surgery Center 
                Expansion, and Lavin Pavilion expansion. 
                        In addition, I helped design a tissue-tracking program to meet 
                Joint Commission Requirements, I built a barcode management program to manage high-dollar, expired and 
                consignment inventory and my team eventually partnered with an external vendor to develop an RFID-tracking system 
                to automate the inventory management (based on the barcode-system I created).
                 During that timeframe, I also fulfilled a dream of mine - completing
        my Master’s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois. </p>
                
             <p>  In 2017, I accepted a position at Stanford Healthcare to help develop and administer an RFID tracking system for inventory 
                management & the planning of their new hospital expansion (currently titled 500P, after the 500 Pasteur 
                Drive location). We’re slated to open in November of 2019 and the breakneck speed at which we work
                     has led to some fun challenges. 
                As a leader in Supply Chain I get to be a 
                Product Manager, a System Administrator, a Project Manager, an Educator, a Data Analyst and more. All of these
                     are driving impacts on our clinical teams and patients.
