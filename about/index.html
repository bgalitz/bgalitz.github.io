<div class="blurb">
        <p>I was an Education major when I began my career in healthcare. Partnering with clients to value their inventory, identify expiring product and recalls.</p>
        <p>This included pharmacies, long-term care facilities and surgery centers.</p>
        
        <p>After taking a position within the OR's at Northwestern, I realized what a dynamic environment the Supply Chain was. 
                I was able to take ownership over problems that I cared about, affect change and 
                advance our organizational goals. Realizing there was a deficit between the technical team and the operational teams, 
                I immediately changed my major to Computer Science and went to work solving departmental challenges.</p>
        <p>I helped develop a tissue-tracking system to meet Joint Commission requirements.</p>
        <p>The success of this system helped gain leadership support to expand into a barcode tracking system I designed to manage tissue, high-dollar and consignment inventory.</p>
        <p>After which, we partnered with an RFID vendor to develop an automated system to manage supplies and implants which allowed us
                to reduce inventory ($3M), eliminate expiring product ($200K per quarter) and create labor efficiencies (reduced labor by 25% while expanding into a half dozen ).</p>
        
        <p>I oversaw the expansion of the following:
                <li>Olson Surgery Center (10 OR's + 1 Anesthesia + 1 SPD + 1 Pre-op/Recovery)</li>
                <li>Prentice Women's hospital (10 OR's + 4 L&D suites + 1 SPD + 1 Pre-Op/Recovery)</li>
                <li>The Lavin Pavilion (16 OR's + 2 SPD's + 2 Pre-Op/Recovery + 2 Anesthesia)</li>
                <li>Grayslake Surgery Center (4 OR's + 1 Pre-Op/Recovery + 1 Anesthesia + 1 SPD)</li>
                <li>Northwestern IR (8 suites), Cath (3 suites), EP Lab (3 Suites)</li></p>
        
        <p>At Stanford, I have been working on the following:
                <li>500P New Hospital Expansion (28 OR's + 1 Anesthesia + 1 SPD + 2 Pre-Op/Recovery)</li>
                <li>Distributor Conversion (Owens & Minor to Medline)</li>
                <li>RFID program design, pilot & implementation</li>
        </p>
